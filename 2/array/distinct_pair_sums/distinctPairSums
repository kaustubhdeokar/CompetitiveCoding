Problem statement: find the no. of distinct numbers that can be formed by using the sum of any two numbers between a range of integers (L,R)

let's take an example of (2,4)

we can form :
2+2(4) 2+3(5) 2+4(6)
	   3+2(5) 3+3(6) 3+4(7)
	    	  				4+4(8)


hence we can see there are many repeating numbers. (like 5,6)

BUT THERE IS A RANGE IN WHICH THESE NUMBERS ARE FORMED. 
the smallest sum we can form = lowest_no +lowest_no.
similarly, the largest = largest_no + largest_no. 

hence we can form each number between (smallest&largest)
									  (4&8) (4,5,6,7,8)

HENCE THAT IS THE ANSWER = LARGEST-SMALLEST+1.	= 8-4+1.
